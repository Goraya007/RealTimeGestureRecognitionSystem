## About The Project
This project involves the implementation of keypoint detection in images and videos using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It leverages OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for keypoints extraction, and TensorFlow for neural network model training.

### Built With
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The project also requires several Python libraries which can be installed via pip.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Goraya007/RealTimeGestureRecognitionSystem.git
   ```
2. Install required Python packages
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib mediapipe tensorflow scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to start keypoint detection:
```sh
python keypoint_final_code.py
```
