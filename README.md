# RealTimeGestureRecognitionSystem
• The system detects and tracks facial landmarks, body poses, and hand movements through webcam input, visualizing them in real-time.  • Developed an LSTM-based deep learning model for recognizing predefined gestures using keypoint data, achieving high accuracy in gesture classification.
